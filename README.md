# Data Migration - IT Venture
There are lots of different files in this repo. The most relevant files are:
- mig_functions.py: this contains the majority of the code. It contains functions that are used by the other files. 
- investee_fund_ops.py: this file collates all files and calls the relevant functions to migrate data for what are known as 'investee' funds 
- managed_fund_ops.py: this file collates all files and calls the relevant functions to migrate data for what are known as 'investee' funds

The code is messy and could be much better designed. I did not expect this automation project to become as large as it has, but hopefully this will give you an idea of what I have been doing and my skill level.
